"""The core Character model.

Three separate TODOs live in this file, for three different days — read
the notes at each one carefully, they're not all unlocked at the same time:

  - Day 1: Character's dunder methods (__repr__, __eq__, __hash__, __lt__,
    __bool__) — same idea as Item in items.py, applied to a class other
    exercises will already be using.
  - Day 4: HealerMixin / TankMixin / LoggableMixin — the mixin & MRO
    workshop.
  - Day 5: GuildMeta — the registry metaclass. Character does NOT use it
    yet (see the class statement below) — wiring it in is literally your
    last Day 5 step, once GuildMeta itself works.

fields.py (StringField/IntField) is already working, so Character's
fields below will validate correctly from Day 1 onward regardless of
which of the above TODOs you've reached.

    Two things your __new__ needs to do, after creating the class via
    super().__new__(...):
      1. Skip registration for the base Character class itself (it has no
         `bases`, i.e. `bases == ()`).
      2. For every other (concrete) subclass: validate that it has an int
         `base_hp` class attribute (directly or inherited) — raise
         TypeError if not — then add it to `GuildMeta.registry` keyed by
         class name.

    Once this works, go to the bottom of this file and change
    `class Character:` to `class Character(metaclass=GuildMeta):` — the
